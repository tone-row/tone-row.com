I’m **really** proud of what [TRACTOR Food & Farms](/partnerships/tractor-food-and-farms) and Tone Row were able to build together.

I’m proud of it because Andrew and I have been collaborating on creative projects since we were 14 years old, and now we’re collaborating on projects equally as creative, but that are going to improve the food ecosystem in Western North Carolina 🤯

I’m proud of what we built, because although we’re not supposed to say things like this, I wasn’t entirely sure I could do it. Sure, I had been part of a team that built apps before; apps that had venture capital and a plethora of project managers– but in those situations I have always had a kanban board, ticket system, or some other way to scope and measure how well I was doing.

When you’re building a tool directly with the people who it’s meant to help, there are no layers of abstraction between the goal you set out to achieve and how you measure your own personal success. The measure of success is precisely how well you achieve the goal… TERRIFYING! 😅

I just patched up what I’m sure won’t be the last little bug to creep into the machine, and while I was doing so I saw that some of the food pantries that TF&F serves had already begun entering the foods that work best for the people they serve. Immediately, I had a big smile on my face. This thing might actually work!

I’m really grateful that Andrew brought this idea to me, that he and TRACTOR were willing to put the time and trust into prototyping, designing, and now using 💫 this app.

This is an awesome first partnership for Tone Row. I can’t wait to see where it leads!
