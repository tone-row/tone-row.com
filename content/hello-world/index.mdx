Howdy 🐛

I've been building websites since 2011.

I want to make cool tools for people to use, like [flowchart.fun](https://flowchart.fun), and I want to make apps that help people, like [Tractor Food & Farms](/partnerships/tractor-food-and-farms).

**Tone Row** is a place to put both of those pursuits under one roof, and document my journey there. Thanks for visiting!
