Howdy 🐛 Person here.

Been building websites since 2011.

Been React'n since 2017 or so.

I want to make cool tools for people to use, like [flowchart.fun](https://flowchart.fun), and I want to make apps that help people, like [Tractor Food & Farms](/partnerships/tractor-food-and-farms).

Tone Row is an experiment in putting both of those pursuits under one roof.

This blog is a document of that experiment.

Thanks for visiting!
