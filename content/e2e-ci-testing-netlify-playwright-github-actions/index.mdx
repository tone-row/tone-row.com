The year was 2018. Assert Conference was held in the La Orilla Del Rio Ballroom in San Antonio, Texas. During one of the presentations, Ex-Paypal-Employee-Turned-Remix-Evangelist Kent C. Dodds presents a "Testing Trophy"; a spin off from a tweet by Guillermo Rauch.

The gist was simple: integration tests.

_Hopefully..._

Fast forward to 2021. With deploy previews Ã  la Netlify and Vercel, Github Actions, and Playwright we may be one step closer to E2E tests that are just as cheap as integration tests.

Let's assume we're working on a website or app hosted on netlify with deploy previews on pull-requests. [Here is an example application](https://github.com/tone-row/easy-e2e), forged in the flames of create-react-app, that stores some text in local storage.

When I make PR's I end up with a fancy netlify preview like so:

<img
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/tone-row/image/upload/v1625167916/tone-row-2021/netlify%20deploy%20preview.png"
  alt="Example netlify deploy preview"

  height="570"
/>

## Goal

- grab the netlify preview url
- run some end-to-end tests with playwright
- sleep better at night!

## Step 1

We'll use a globally installed version of `playwright` so the only package we need to add to our repo is the test runner.

```shell
yarn add -D @playwright/test
```

## Step 2

Add an `e2e` npm script to run it.

```json
"e2e": "npx playwright test --browser=all e2e"
```

This is going to run any tests in our `e2e` folder in Chrome, Firefox, Safari.

## Step 3

Create the folder we referenced above and add one test file.

```bash
mkdir e2e && touch e2e/app.spec.ts
```

## Step 4

Let's test that our page has the correct title:

```tsx
// app.spec.ts
import { test as base, expect } from "@playwright/test";

const test = base.extend<{ url: string }>({
  url: process.env.E2E_START_URL ?? "http://localhost:3000",
});

const { describe, beforeEach } = test;

describe("App", () => {
  beforeEach(async ({ page, url }) => {
    await page.goto(url as string);
  });

  test("Correct Page Title", async ({ page }) => {
    const title = await page.title();

    // Replace this with your app's page title
    //                 â¤µ
    expect(title).toBe("Save Some Text");
  });
});
```

We use `base.extend` to pass fixtures (in our case `url`) to each of our test runs.

## Step 5 â€“Â Test Locally

In one shell, start your app (`yarn start` for create-react-app).

In another shell, try `yarn e2e`. You may need to install some playwright dependencies the first time you run it, but you should see 3 tests run and pass.

For a little added spice, try `yarn e2e --headed`. This will open the browser window and give you some good insight into what the test runner does behind the scenes.

## Step 6 â€“ Continuous Integration with Github Actions

If you don't already have any github actions running, create the directory `.github/workflows` in the root of your repo. Then add the following code a file called `e2e.yml`

```yaml
# .github/workflows/e2e.yml
name: E2E Tests

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 12.x
      - name: Setup Playwright
        run: npx playwright install-deps
      - name: Install
        run: yarn install
      - name: Waiting for 200 from the Netlify Preview
        uses: jakepartusch/wait-for-netlify-action@v1.2
        id: waitFor200
        with:
          site_name: "reverent-joliot-43ca55" # <-- replace with your site url
      - name: Run E2E Tests on Netlify URL
        run: E2E_START_URL="${{ steps.waitFor200.outputs.url }}" yarn e2e
```

If you haven't seen a github action before, this yaml file is saying, "On pull requests, run each of these steps in order". You can learn more about writing github actions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

Individual steps can actually reference other github actions. The magic ingredient of our e2e tests is an action created by [Jake Partusch](https://twitter.com/JakePartusch), which waits for and returns the netlify deploy preview url. Afterwards we store the url on an environment variable and run our end-to-end script.

Don't forget to change the `site_name` to your netlify site's ID. You can
find that by logging into netlify and looking at your project.

## Bada Bing Bada Boom

That's it! You should now be able to open up a pull requests on your app, and GitHub will run end-to-end tests on the netlify deploy preview url.

## Writing Better Tests

Obviously testing the page's title isn't going to give you much confidence in your app. Here are a few more tests I added to the demo app, to give you an idea of what playwright tests look like.

```ts
import { test as base, expect } from "@playwright/test";

type Fixtures = { url: string };

const test = base.extend<Fixtures>({
  url: process.env.E2E_START_URL ?? "http://localhost:3000",
});

const { describe, beforeEach } = test;

describe("App", () => {
  beforeEach(async ({ page, url }) => {
    await page.goto(url as string);
  });

  test("Correct Page Title", async ({ page }) => {
    const title = await page.title();
    expect(title).toBe("Save Some Text");
  });

  test("Displays user input", async ({ page }) => {
    await page.click("input");
    // Fill input
    await page.fill("input", "This is working");

    const display = await page.innerText("span.display");

    expect(display).toEqual("This is working");
  });

  test("Retains text on refresh", async ({ page }) => {
    await page.click("input");
    // Fill input
    await page.fill("input", "This is working");

    let display = await page.innerText("span.display");

    expect(display).toEqual("This is working");

    await page.reload();

    display = await page.innerText("span.display");

    expect(display).toEqual("This is working");
  });
});
```

One of the amazing features of playwright is the ability to generate code for your tests via the [codegen CLI command](https://playwright.dev/docs/cli#generate-code). You'll definitely want to have a look at that.

This tutorial was meant to be as bare-bones as possible, but if you think I left something important out please let me know on twitter ([@tone_row\_](https://twitter.com/tone_row_)) or for typos make a PR on [this article's source code](https://github.com/tone-row/tone-row.com/blob/main/content/e2e-ci-testing-netlify-playwright-github-actions/index.mdx).

Thanks for reading!
